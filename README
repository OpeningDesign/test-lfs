# Git-LFS test

This repo is here to test LFS support

### Procedure

1. Install Git-LFS on your computer
2. Warning, this works only fully for a new repo. You can go further on an
existing repo, but only revisions after this point will be handled by LFS.
That is, all revisions committed before now will stay as they are. There is a
way to migrate all previous commits to LFS, but it will rewrite all your
history, which one should not do (will un-sync will all other copies of the
repo)
3. Inside the repo: `git lfs install`
4. Inside the repo: `git lfs track "*.rvt"
5. Check that a `.gitattributes` is created
6. Commit some files
7. Push

Normally that's all. After that everything should "just work" as normal...
